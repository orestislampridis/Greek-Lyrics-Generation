# Greek-Lyrics-Generation

Implementation of lyric generation machine learning models in the Greek language for the genre of Ã‰ntekhno music. To accomplish this, we used three different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approaches. The first method utilizes word-level bidirectional LSTMs, the second method expands on the first by learning the word embeddings on the initial layer of the network, while the last method is based on a char-level LSTM.

First two approaches based on code in [enriqueav's repo](https://github.com/enriqueav/lstm_lyrics).
